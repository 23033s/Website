 <h1><b>What is Plastic Pollution?</b></h1>
 <br>
 <p class="main-paragraph"><b>Plastic pollution</b> is when <b>plastic waste ends up</b> in the <b>environment</b> like in our oceans, rivers, streets, and land instead of being properly <b>recycled</b> or <b>thrown away</b>.

 <h2> Why Plastic Pollution Matters</h2>

 <p class="main-paragraph">
     Because <b>plastic</b> takes <b>hundreds of years</b> to <b>break</b> down, it <b>stays</b> in the <b>environment</b> for a <b>long time</b> and can <b>harm</b> animals, sea life, and even people.
     <br>
     But not just New Zealand is facing plastic pollution.
     <br>
     <b>Plastic Pollution</b> is a <b>massive problem</b> not just in Auckland or New Zealand, but also the <b>whole</b> world.</p>

 <p><strong>Kaitiakitanga Quote:</strong> "Ko au te whenua, te whenua ko au." - A Māori proverb that translates to "I am the land, the land is me".</p>
 <br>
 <p>This quote signifies a deep, inseparable connection (physical and spiritual) between the Māori people and the land.</p>
 <br>
<p>The quote is more than just words; it represents a worldview where the land is not simply a resource, but also an essential part of identity, heritage, and wellbeing. </p>
 <br>
 <p><b>See the land as yourself and protect it, protect it like you would protect yourself.</b></p>

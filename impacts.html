 <p><strong>Kaitiakitanga Quote:</strong> "Manaaki whenua, manaaki tāngata, haere whakamua" - This whakataukī translates to "If we take care of the land and take care of the people, we will take care of the future." </p>
 <br>
 <p>This quote signifies a deep, inseparable connection (physical and spiritual) between the Māori people and the land.</p>
 <br>
<p>The quote is more than just words; it represents a worldview where the land is not simply a resource, but also an essential part of identity, heritage, and wellbeing. </p>
 <br>
 <p><b>See the land as yourself and protect it, protect it like you would protect yourself.</b></p>

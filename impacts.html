 <h2><b>Plastic Pollution Impacts | Understanding the Consequences</b></h2>
 <br>
 <p class="main-paragraph"><b>Plastic pollution</b> is not just an environmental issue, it also <b>directly affects</b> marine life, our food chain, and even human health.</p>
 <br>

 <h3><strong>Key Impacts of Plastic Pollution</strong></h3>
<div class="explanation">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Harm to Marine Life:</strong> Animals can ingest plastic or get entangled, leading to injury or death.</li>
    <li><strong>Food Chain Contamination:</strong> Microplastics enter fish and seafood, which humans then consume, risking health problems.</li>
    <li><strong>Environmental Damage:</strong> Plastic pollution disrupts ecosystems and habitats, affecting biodiversity.</li>
    <li><strong>Human Health Risks:</strong> Chemicals from plastics can leach into water and food, potentially causing illnesses.</li>
    <li><strong>Economic Costs:</strong> Cleaning up plastic pollution is expensive and harms industries like tourism and fishing.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="explanation2">
  <p><strong>Harm to Marine Life:</strong>
    Every year, millions of marine animals are harmed by plastic waste.
    Sea turtles often mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and eat them, leading to internal blockages and slow death.
    Birds like albatrosses feed plastic pieces to their chicks, thinking it's food.
    This causes malnutrition and can be fatal.
    Seals and dolphins often get trapped in old fishing nets or six-pack rings, which can lead to injury, infection, or drowning.
    These incidents are common and deeply damaging to marine ecosystems.

 <p><strong>Kaitiakitanga Quote:</strong> "Manaaki whenua, manaaki tāngata, haere whakamua" - This whakataukī translates to "If we take care of the land and take care of the people, we will take care of the future." </p>
 <br>
 <p>This quote signifies a deep, inseparable connection (physical and spiritual) between the Māori people and the land.</p>
 <br>
<p>The quote is more than just words; it represents a worldview where the land is not simply a resource, but also an essential part of identity, heritage, and wellbeing. </p>
 <br>
 <p><b>See the land as yourself and protect it, protect it like you would protect yourself.</b></p>

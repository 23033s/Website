       <h3>Why Kaitiakitanga Matters </h3>
        <br>
       <p>Kaitiakitanga is important because it helps us care for the land, sea, and nature around us.
          Kaitiakitanga teaches us to look after the environment so future generations (such as your future children) can enjoy living in a clean environment.
          By using kaitiakitanga, we protect our world and show respect for the Māori values that connect us to the earth.</p>
        <br>
       <h3>Caring for the Environment </h3>
        <br>
        <p>Caring for the environment is a very big part of kaitiakitanga, but we don't do that with plastic.
           When we throw away plastic, we are harming wildlife, sealife and polluting our very own oceans.
           By using less plastic, recycling, and making good choices, we show care for nature and the environment.
           Kaitiakitanga helps us take action to protect our planet.</p>
        <br>
       <h3>Become a Kaitiaki</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Being a kaitiaki means taking action to protect the environment.
           You can be a kaitiaki by picking up rubbish, using less plastic, planting trees, and encouraging others to care too.
           As again, kaitiakitanga isn’t just an idea, it’s something we should do every day to help Papatūānuku, our Earth mother.
            <br>
            <br>
           <b>Take action and protect our land by becoming a Kaitiaki now!</b></p>

 <p><strong>Kaitiakitanga Quote:</strong> "Toitū te whenua, whatungarongaro te tangata." - This whakataukī translates to "The land remains, while people come and go" </p>
 <br>
 <p>This quote tells us that we must care for the land so it can continue long after we are gone.</p>
 <br>
 <p> Through plastic pollution we are damaging the long-term health of our land, we must stop this.</p>
